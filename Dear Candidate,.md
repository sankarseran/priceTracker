Dear Candidate,

We'd like you to complete a coding exercise to take the interview process to the next level.
We genuinely encourage you to ask lots of questions if you need clarification, if you have any
ideas or if something isn't going as planned. This is for you as much as it is for us. We want
you to get a sense of what it's like to work with us.

Challenge
Your task is to build a simple cryptocurrency price tracker. The pages of the app and their
functionality are outlined below:
● Homepage:
    ○ On first visit: The user is presented with a searchable list of cryptocurrencies
    (assets). These can be selected as favourites.
    ○ Subsequent visits: The user is shown real-time pricing information for each of
    the cryptocurrencies (assets) marked as favourites.

● Favourites page:
○ On subsequent visits to the app, the user can edit favourites.

What do we expect?
● Cryptocurrency data should be obtained via the coinapi.io API (use free tier);
● The solution should showcase the use of the ngrx library;
● Try to use mobile-first design;
● Automated testing of the solution is encouraged;
● The use of libraries such as Angular Material/Bootstrap/Tailwind is acceptable;
● Avoid over-engineering :) This is not meant for production.
